# All-Data-Structures - JAVA
**This repository contains the implementation of all the data structures, and searching and sorting Algorithms**

## CONTENTS:

This project contains the implementation of the data structures and algorithms listed below:

* [X] ARRAYS
* [X] DOUBLE DIMMENSION ARRAYS
* [X] STACKS
* [X] QUEUE - SINGLE ENDED
* [X] QUEUE - DOUBLE ENDED
* [X] QUEUE - PRIORITY
* [X] QUEUE - CIRCULAR
* [X] LINKEDLIST - SINGLY LINKED
* [X] LINKEDLIST - DOUBLY LINKED
* [X] LINKEDLIST - CIRCULAR
* [X] BINARY TREE
* [X] BINARY SEARCH TREE
* [X] HEAP
* [X] HASH TABLE, HASH SET
* [X] GRAPHS
* [X] RECURSION PROBLEMS
* [X] SORTING ALGORITHMS - INSERTION SORT, SELECTION SORT, BUBBLE SORT, COUNTING SORT, MERGE SORT, QUICK SORT


## NOTES:

**For data structures, the implementation consists of Insertion (beginning, end, particular index), Deletion (beginning, end, particular index), Search, Sort, and Traverse.**

**For Sorting algorithms, the implementation consists of a randomly generated array on which the sorting algorithm is performed.**

*This project is for learning purposes and created by **Aishwar Gupta***
